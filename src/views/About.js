    <h1>I'm Jeffrey Bentley</h1>
<h3>Full Stack Software Engineer && Web Developer</h3>
<br></br>
<p>I began exploring Software Engineering and Web Development as a way to build solutions for people.
    I used to use actual hardware to create solutions for individuals and businesses, now I use software.
    Being a Software Engineer, I am familiar with teaching myself new technologies. Eventually, I studied 
    at <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/web-development" target="_blank">Galvanize</a>, the premiere Software 
    Engineering Bootcamp. While there, I studied modern JavaScript frameworks, practices and deployment. Focusing 
    on React for the front-end, Node with Express on the back.  Since then, the desire to continue learning 
    has led me to explore other frameworks and libraries such as Angular and VUE.
